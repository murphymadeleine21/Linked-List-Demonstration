# Linked-List-Demonstration
Demonstrates use of linked lists.

Each sequence is a doubly-linked list with head and tail pointers. Each node in the sequence has an m_next and an m_prev. The test cases are meant for different ItemTypes so will not all run together depending on what ItemType you have assigned.
